At start, we need to move the big box which block the door and get into the first room.
In the first room, there is a fixed enemy which will shoot projectile in random direction constantly. Getting hit by the projectile will deduct HP, got knock off and lose control for a short while. However, you can jump and attack his head to eliminate him.
If we go to the next room directly, we will get boomed into sky and fail the game instantly by the mine deployed in the door way. The correct way is to move the box in the room to right place and using it to jump to next room. 
Before goes up to the house upstair, we need to finish the patroling enemy, who will chase us if we step into his territory, by jump and attack his head. Same, we will get HP deduction if we get caught by him.
The lower half of the stair was gone, however, we can follow the healing package and find a box which can help us get on the stair in the corner.
Final room before finishing the level is a room with Klotski game, however, there is also mine and fixed enemy between the box. Once we find our way out the box maze, we can go in last room and win.
